# About UHMSpaceBar

[UHM Spacebar](http://uhmspacebar.meteorapp.com) is how University of Hawaii at Manoa students can get connected with any RIO/non-RIO club on campus. When accessing the meteor application, the following landing page appears:

We will be providing UHM members the ability to login through CAS login. After authenticating the UH login the user is then prompted to make a user profile

[Profile Page](http://uhmspacebar.meteorapp.com/nn4/profile)

This is what a standard user profile will look like after creating. They will be able to have a feed of upcoming events for clubs that they add to their watchlist and can filter the upcoming events based on club. It will also show a description of the events. They are also able to edit any of their information here.

[Filter Page](http://uhmspacebar.meteorapp.com/nn4/filter)

We will also provide users to find new clubs that they are interested in. We will show various club options on the left side of the screen and allow users to filter based on personal preferences. Each club will have a json value associated with their name (string comparison), club type, club size, and major affiliation (macro values).

[Club Register](http://uhmspacebar.meteorapp.com/nn4/Club_Register)

For new or existing clubs that would like to sign up on UHMSpaceBar, they can access the Register New Club page. This will prompt them with a form to fill out. This will add new clubs to the database. There are a few fields in the register period in attempt to reduce friction of onboarding. Users can/will be prompted to add more personalization while using the web application.
